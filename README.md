Reddit Digest
=============

The very finest curated list of links from Reddit for busy readers.

[Reddit Digest][1] has been built to reduce procrastination by
fetching only the best content published during a chosen period of time from
groups of high quality subreddits. News, Science, Tech, and Insightful are the
default groups but everything is directly customizable from the browser without
creating an account.

Note: this project has been mostly depreciated by the launch of the [official
multireddits functionality][2] in June 2013.
